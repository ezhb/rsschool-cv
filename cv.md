## At the present time

I continue to learn HTML, JavaScript, React and TypeScript

## Brief information about me

I work in web development for a little over 1 year - freelance and project work. All this time I've been doing both layout layout sites and creating sites on content management systems (Joomla, Wordpress). In the process, my knowledge was not enough, so I turned my attention to JavaScript and React to create easily scalable applications.

I am an easy learner, diligent and stress-resistant. I lead an active and healthy lifestyle, no bad habits.

You can see some sample code on my [my github](https://github.com/ezhb)

## My skills

I am learning JavaScript and React, recently started Typescript. Familiar with Agile and Waterfall development methodology. In my work I use the Git version control system, the development environment is WebStorm, for minor edits of the Sublime Text code.
